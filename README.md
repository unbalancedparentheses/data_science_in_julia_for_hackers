## Table of contents

### Part I: Data Science and Julia
* [First chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/01_science_technology_and_epistemology.jl.html): Science, technology, models and epistemology.

* [Second chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/02_julia_intro.jl.html): Introduction to the Julia programming language, showing examples of code and some first steps.

### Part II: Bayesian Statistics
* [Third chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com:wq/03_probability_intro.jl.html): An introduction to probability, probability distributions and Bayes' interpretation.

* [Fourth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/04_naive_bayes.jl.html): Using a Naive-Bayes approach we construct a simple spam email filter.

* [Fifth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/05_prob_prog_intro.jl.html): An introduction to Probabilistic Programming and some simple examples using the Turing.jl package.

* [Sixth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/06_gravity.jl.html): We estimate the gravity of Mars to compute the escape velocity, throwing stones and taking very simple measurements from it.

* [Seventh chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/07_football_simulation.jl.html): We use a hierarchical bayesian model to estimate latent variables that describe Premier League´s football teams.

* [Eighth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/08_basketball_shots.jl.html): We analyze how the scoring probability is affected by some variables, such as the distance from the hoop and the angle of shooting.

* [Ninth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/09_optimal_pricing.jl.html): We solve a problem of optimal pricing optimization using a bayesian point of view.

### Part III: Machine Learning
* Work in progress

### Part IV: Deep Learning
* [Tenth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/10_bees_vs_wasps.jl.html): Overview of Machine Learning and implementation of a simple convolutional neural network that is able to discriminate between pictures of bees and wasps..

### Part V: Scientific Machine Learning
* [Eleventh chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/11_ultima_online.jl.html): We explain the Ultima Online Catastrophe using differential equations to build a population dynamics model.

* [Twelfth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/12_ultima_continued.jl.html): A continuation of the Ultima Online Catastrophe, introducing the Universal Differential Equations to recover missing parts of scientific models.

### Part VI: Time Series and Forecasting
* [Thirteenth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/13_time_series.jl.html): We lay the foundations for time series analysis, focusing on the exponential smoothing method.
